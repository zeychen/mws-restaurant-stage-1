# Restaurant Reviews
---

Restaurant reviews is a responsive web app that loads reviews of restaurants in New York City. It functions on any device or screen size and is designed to be mobile first. Additionally, it meets the highest development by achieving accessibility standards.

### Running The Project
1. Start up a simple HTTP server. I used Python 2.x:  `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) You can also use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. Go to `http://localhost:8000` to see site.
